## **Day 1:**
- **Topic:** Introduction to SketchUp
  - Explore the interface, toolbars, and navigation tools.
- **Shortcuts to Learn:**
  - `O`: Orbit tool
  - `H`: Pan tool
  - `Z`: Zoom tool
  - `R`: Rectangle tool
  - `P`: Push/Pull tool
  - `T`: Tape Measure tool
  - `S`: Scale tool
  - `Q`: Rotate tool
  - `Ctrl` (with Move): Copy
  - `F`: Offset tool
  - `Space`: Select tool

- **Exercise:** Create a 3D Table

### **Process:**
1. **Create the Table Surface:**
   - Use the Rectangle tool (`R`) to draw a rectangle (60" x 60").
   - Use the Push/Pull tool (`P`) to extrude the rectangle upward by 0.75" to form the table surface.

2. **Add the Apron:**
   - Use the Tape Measure tool (`T`) to create a guideline 6" inward from all sides.
   - Use the Rectangle tool (`R`) to draw a new rectangle on the guidelines.
   - Use the Offset tool (`F`) to create an inset of 0.75" from the new rectangle.
   - Delete the middle part of the rectangle.
   - Use the Push/Pull tool (`P`) to extrude the apron downward by 6".

3. **Create the Table Legs:**
   - Use the Rectangle tool (`R`) to draw a 2" x 2" square at one corner of the table.
   - Use the Push/Pull tool (`P`) to extrude the leg upward by 6".
   - Hold `Ctrl` to continue extruding an additional 30" upward, forming the leg.
   - Make the leg a component (right-click → Make Component) and name it appropriately.

4. **Duplicate the Legs:**
   - Use the Move tool (`M`) with `Ctrl` to copy the leg to other corners.
   - Use guidelines (`T`) and the Shift key for precise placement.
   - Use the Rotate tool (`Q`) if necessary to align the legs.

5. **Refine the Legs:**
   - Use the Scale tool (`S`) to taper the bottom of the legs inward by 0.75".
